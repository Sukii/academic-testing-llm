# Does virus have life?

That's an interesting and complex question. Whether viruses are considered to be "alive" or not is a subject of ongoing debate and discussion among biologists and scientists.
Viruses exhibit some characteristics that are typically associated with living organisms, such as the ability to replicate and evolve. However, they also lack some key features that are generally considered essential for life, such as the ability to perform cellular respiration, metabolize nutrients, and reproduce independently.
The debate around the "life" status of viruses centers around how we define "life" and the criteria we use to make that determination. Some scientists argue that viruses should be considered a unique form of life, while others believe they are not truly alive and are instead a kind of "infectious agent" or "replicating molecule."
Ultimately, there is no clear consensus on whether viruses can be considered living organisms. The classification of viruses is an active area of research and discussion in the scientific community. The answer to your question depends on how one defines and conceptualizes "life" in the context of virology and biology.

# What about prions, are they living beings?

Prions are not generally considered to be living organisms. Unlike viruses, prions do not have the characteristic features that are typically associated with living things.
Prions are infectious agents, but they are not made up of cells and do not have genetic material like DNA or RNA. Instead, prions are misfolded proteins that are able to propagate by converting normal versions of the same protein into the abnormal, misfolded shape.
Some key reasons why prions are not considered to be living beings:
    1. Lack of cellular structure: Prions are not composed of cells, which is a fundamental characteristic of all known living organisms.
    2. Absence of genetic material: Prions do not contain any genetic information encoded in DNA or RNA. They are simply misshapen proteins.
    3. Unable to replicate independently: Prions cannot replicate on their own. They require the presence of the normal version of the protein to convert into the infectious prion form.
    4. No metabolism or growth: Prions do not exhibit the metabolic activities or growth patterns that are hallmarks of living organisms.
So in summary, while prions are infectious agents that can cause serious diseases, they are not classified as living beings in the biological sense. They are considered to be non-living infectious proteins rather than living organisms.

# What were the earliest redimentary life froms, just proteins, RNA?

The earliest rudimentary life forms on Earth are believed to have emerged from prebiotic chemistry and the formation of simple organic molecules, which eventually led to the development of more complex biomolecules and primitive cellular structures.
The current scientific consensus suggests that the earliest forms of life were likely based on RNA (ribonucleic acid) rather than DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or proteins. This hypothesis is known as the "RNA world" theory.
The key evidence and understanding around the earliest life forms are as follows:
1. RNA-based life:
- RNA is capable of storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions, much like DNA and proteins.
- RNA is considered a more primitive and simpler molecule compared to DNA and proteins.
- The RNA world theory proposes that early life forms were based on self-replicating RNA molecules that could carry out basic metabolic functions.
2. Prebiotic chemistry:
- Before the emergence of life, there was a period of prebiotic chemistry, where simple organic molecules like amino acids, nucleobases, and sugars were formed through various chemical reactions.
- These prebiotic molecules could have served as the building blocks for the first biomolecules and primitive cellular structures.
3. Protocells and early metabolism:
- The earliest life forms are believed to have been simple, primitive structures called "protocells" - compartmentalized systems that could maintain a basic metabolism and undergo rudimentary replication.
- These protocells may have been composed of lipids, RNA, and other essential biomolecules.
- The development of basic metabolic pathways and the ability to harness energy sources were crucial for the evolution of these early life forms.
The precise timeline and details of the emergence of the earliest life forms on Earth are still being actively investigated by scientists. However, the current evidence strongly suggests that the initial stages of life were likely based on RNA-like molecules and simple cellular structures, rather than fully developed DNA-based organisms or complex proteins.
